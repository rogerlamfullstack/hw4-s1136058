After using the Reweighing method, the **Statistical Parity Difference (SPD)** got better more than the **Equalized Odds Difference (EOD)**. This means the method helped reduce unfair differences in positive outcomes between races.

But, the accuracy dropped a little. Thatâ€™s a common side effect when trying to make models fairer. In this case, it's okay because fairness is more important in systems like criminal justice.After applying the Reweighing mitigation technique, the **Statistical Parity Difference (SPD)** showed a greater improvement compared to the **Equalized Odds Difference (EOD)**. This indicates that the mitigation was more effective at reducing overall bias in the distribution of positive predictions across races.

However, this improvement came with a **slight drop in accuracy**, which is a common trade-off in fairness interventions. In this context, such a trade-off is acceptable because the primary goal is to reduce systemic bias in high-stakes decision-making systems like criminal justice risk assessments.
